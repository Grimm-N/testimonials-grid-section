## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I've come to appreciate the beauty of using CSS Grid even more. Itâ€™s amazing how flexible and powerful it is for creating layouts. I feel like I'm getting the hang of it!

### Continued development

My goal remains the same: to learn how to create perfectly mobile-adapted websites. I'm dedicated to mastering this skill.

### Useful resources

- [A (more) Modern CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/) - Thanks to Andy Bell for his wonderful cheat sheet! I'm using it, adapting it to my needs, and I highly recommend it to everyone.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - I always revisit the information on this site whenever I feel stuck. It's an excellent knowledge library, and I find it incredibly helpfu.
